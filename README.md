# Phase 1 Final Project

This repository includes all files for the final submission for the Phase 1 project.

## Project Overview

For this project, we used movie data to determine what types of films have been performing best at the box office and then provide recommendations to the stakeholder.

## Business Understanding

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. 

In this project, we will attempt to answer the questions:

* What type of movies with the most absolute profit?
* What type of movies with the best profit percentages?
* What do customer viewing trends look like in recent years?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data

* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) - Used to retrieve movie financials including budgets/revenues.

* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) - Used to retrieve basic movie info to sort genres.

### Description of Data

For this analysis, the movie population will consist of:

* Movies released from 2010-2019.
* Movies with worldwide gross revenue over $20 million.
* Movies will be grouped into nine high-level genres for comparison purposes. 

Additional expenses such as Distribution/Marketing were not included in this analysis.

Include types of genres.....

### Visualizations

## Conclusions

Action movies had the hightest total revenue, but also higher risk of losses. Horror movies had the greatest profit percentage. The viewing trends showed clear increases for 'experience' movies such as Horror, Action, heavy special-effect - types of movies that are best seen in theater environment.

### Recommendations

* Focus on experiences that cannot be duplicated at home. Headlined Action and Horror genres.
* Lower-risk genres should be a core to start. These include the Horror, Family and Historical Drama genres.
* Higher-risk Action movies should also be included with the understanding that there is a higher chance of loss.

Microsoft can leverage their video game catalog options. IPs like Elder Scrolls, Fallout and Minecraft can adapt to the desired genres.
